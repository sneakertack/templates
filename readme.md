Here, I keep starter templates to help me start building stuff. For now the stuff I build tends to revolve around web applications.

# Stack

These are the languages/frameworks that I prefer to use:

- Markup: Jade
- Styling (base): Bootstrap
- Styling (custom): SCSS if big, CSS if small
- Client-side: JS, Angular.js
- Server-side: Node.js
- CLI programs: Node.js
- Databases: Undecided between Postgres or Mongo. Also, Firebase and Rethink are interesting.
- DevOps: Heroku

So templates will tend to favour these languages/frameworks' way of doing things.
